## Introduction

This Tic-Tac-Toe game was developed as a part of a **Task** given by My Senior. The objective was to create a fully functional game with a graphical interface, demonstrating proficiency in Java and Swing.

## Features

- User-friendly graphical interface.
- Randomized first turn selection.
- Visual indicators for win conditions.
- Simple and intuitive gameplay.

## Installation

To run this game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-game.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd tic-tac-toe-game
    ```

3. **Compile the Java files**:
    ```sh
    javac Main.java
    ```

4. **Run the game**:
    ```sh
    java Main
    ```

## Usage

- Upon running the game, a window will appear with a 3x3 grid and a title indicating the current player's turn.
- Players take turns clicking on the empty cells to place their marks (X or O).
- The game will automatically check for win conditions after each turn.
- The game ends when either player wins or all cells are filled (resulting in a tie).

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Player 1 is assigned the "X" mark, and Player 2 is assigned the "O" mark.
- Players take turns placing their marks in empty cells.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all cells are filled and no player has three marks in a row, the game is a tie.

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind this project was to apply the concepts learned in the course and create an engaging and interactive application. This project allowed me to improve my skills in Java programming, particularly in using the Swing library for building graphical user interfaces. It also helped me understand game logic implementation and event handling in Java.
